HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundational technologies for building web pages. HTML structures content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactive functionality.

This GitHub repository is a comprehensive resource for practicing key web development skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes examples of responsive web design, interactive elements, and dynamic content, providing a comprehensive learning resource for building and styling web pages while enhancing user interactivity. It encompasses examples and exercises on HTML forms, which are essential for user input, and image mapping, a technique that allows different areas of an image to be interactive links. The repository also delves into JavaScript loops and conditionals, fundamental for controlling the flow of code and executing repetitive tasks efficiently.

Additionally, it covers the three main ways to apply CSS: inline, internal, and external. Inline CSS is used for quick, specific styling within an HTML element, internal CSS is defined within a `<style>` tag in the HTML document's `<head>` section, and external CSS involves linking to an external stylesheet, promoting cleaner code and reusability. Together, these practice files offer a robust platform for mastering web development.
