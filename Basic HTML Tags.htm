HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. <BR>
For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. <BR>
The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
</FONT></P>

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. <BR>
You can put elements inside other elements too â€” this is called nesting.
